# 2-layer-RCE-model
This is a very simple model of vertical energy transfer and temperatures in the Earth system, intended to be used for teaching and learning about weather and climate.

There are two layers of atmosphere and a single layer of surface. The atmosphere is perfectly transparent to solar radiation, so sunshine warms the surface directly without changing the atmosphere. The warm surface then transfers heat to the overlying atmosphere both by radiation of (thermal) infrared radiation and by upward convective heat flux.

The model consists of three equations (conservation of energy in each layer) in three unknowns (the three temperatures).
